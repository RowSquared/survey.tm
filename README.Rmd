# r2.tms

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Collection of wrappers for Translation Management for surveys/censuses. 
TBC.

## Installation

You can install the development version of r2.tms through

``` r
devtools::install_github("petbrueck/r2.tms")
```

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

- Google Account to use [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) 


### Set up

Before working with one or more questionnaires, you need to get a google worksheet that will serve as the "Translation Master Sheet". 

Please note: If you have not used any functionality of package `googlesheets4` before, at first run of any `r2.tms` function, you will need to generate an access token. Follow instructions in console and browser.

```  {r setup, eval=FALSE}
# Optional: Indicate to `googlesheets4` which mail you will use. Avoids selecting pre-authorised account manually.
# googlesheets4::gs4_auth(email = "your.email@address.com")
# Set up sheet, specify:
# - Name to assign to new google worksheet
# - Translations/Languages needed. Can be one or multiple as in this example. Needs to be ISO 639-1 name.
setup_tsheet(
  ssheet_name = "Project X: Translation Sheet",
  lang_names = c("German", "French")
)
```


### Workflow


#### Pull the Questionnaire Template from Survey Solutions Designer 

To retrieve the current version and text items of the questionnaire(s) you're working with, you can use the `get_suso_tfiles()` function. This function downloads the [questionnaire templates](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/questionnaire-designer/toolbar/multilingual-questionnaires/) in Excel format from the Survey Solutions Designer and stores them as nested lists in your environment. You can specify the questionnaires by using their questionnaire ID, which is a 32-character alphanumeric identifier. 


You can find this ID by logging in to the Survey Solutions Designer and accessing your questionnaire. The URL in your browser should look like `https://designer.mysurvey.solutions/questionnaire/details/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`, where the combination of x's after `/details/` represents your questionnaire ID.

```  {r get_suso_tfiles, eval=FALSE}

# Define the questionnaire IDs you want to retrieve translations for
questionnaires <- c("a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6", "b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6a7")

# Retrieve the translation files
suso_trans_templates <- get_suso_tfiles(
  questionnaires = questionnaires,
  user = "your_email@example.com", # Registered with Survey Solutions Designer
  password = "your_password",
  sheets = c("Translations", "Options")
)

# Access the translations for the first questionnaire
translations_first_questionnaire <- suso_trans_templates[["NAME OF YOUR QUESTIONNAIRE"]]
# Access the "Translations" sheet for the first questionnaire
translations_sheet_first_questionnaire <- translations_first_questionnaire[["Translations"]]
# Note: The last four rows are an example of how to access the returned object "suso_trans_templates". In most cases, you will not need to access the object in this way.

```
