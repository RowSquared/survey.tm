## Installation

You can install the development version of r2.tms through

To this end

```  {r setup, eval=FALSE}
#Optional: Indicate to `googlesheets4` which mail you will use. Avoids selecting pre-authorised account manually. 
googlesheets4::gs4_auth(email = "your.email@address.com")
#Set up sheet
setup_tsheet(
    name.ssheet="Project X: Translation Sheet",
    translation.languages=c("German","French")
)
```
